## Overview 

I chose to use simplicity when doing the task, I know that there are better ways to do it, however, I believe that it is better to deliver something functional and that can be improved later than to deliver something that doesn't work or won't deliver anything.

I made basic comparisons of methods and status codes, which worked. I also tried to make a comparison using 'name' inside the request header, however, I ended up not being able to make it work.

Normally I would have deleted the flawed code, however I chose to leave it commented so that you can analyze my line of reasoning if you wish.

## Technologies used

I chose to use javascript for simplicity.
